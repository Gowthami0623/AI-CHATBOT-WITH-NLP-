 ## AI CHATBOT WITH NLP
 
### Objective of my Project
The aim is to create a chatbot capable of engaging in conversations and answering user queries effectively using Natural Language Processing techniques. The chatbot uses libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or SpaCy to process and understand human language.

### How the NLP Libraries Work
#### NLTK:
NLTK is a widely-used Python library for basic NLP tasks. It handles tokenization, stop word removal, and text classification.
It's particularly useful for simple tasks like keyword-based intent detection.

#### SpaCy:
SpaCy is a faster and more advanced library designed for real-world applications.
It provides features like named entity recognition (NER), dependency parsing, and keyword extraction, which help make the chatbot's responses more context-aware.

### # Steps to Build Your Chatbot
Design the Structure:
Define the basic flow of conversation: greetings, question-answer interactions, and farewells.
# Use NLP for Text Preprocessing:
The chatbot processes user input by:
Breaking it into smaller chunks (words or phrases).
Cleaning up the input by removing unnecessary words (e.g., "is," "the").
Identifying meaningful keywords or patterns.
Intent Matching:Match the cleaned input to a predefined list of intents. For example:
If the input contains "hello" or "hi," the chatbot recognizes it as a greeting intent.

### Generate Responses:
After identifying the intent, the chatbot selects a corresponding response. For example:
For "hello," the chatbot might reply, "Hello! How can I help you?"

### Run in a Loop:
Keep the chatbot running so it can process multiple inputs until the user decides to exit the conversation.

#### Example Scenario:
how My chatbot might handle a conversation:
User Input: The user says, "Hi."
The chatbot processes the input, recognizes the "greeting" intent, and replies, "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
User Input: The user asks, "What can you do?"
The chatbot recognizes a generic question intent and replies, "I can answer your questions, provide recommendations, or just have a chat with you!"
User Input: The user says, "Thanks."
The chatbot identifies the "thanks" intent and responds, "You're welcome! Let me know if there's anything else I can help with."
User Input: The user says, "Bye."
The chatbot recognizes the "farewell" intent and replies, "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
Error Handling: Make the chatbot robust by providing responses for unrecognized inputs, such as "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you rephrase?"
